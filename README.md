# Snake Game in Pygame

## Introduction

This Python script implements a simple Snake game using the Pygame library. In this classic game, the player controls a snake that moves around the screen to eat food while avoiding collisions with the screen edges and itself.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the `snake_game.py` script in your Python environment.
3. Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement.
4. Eat the black food squares to increase your score.
5. Avoid running into the screen edges or the snake's own body to prevent a game over.

## Features

- **Snake Movement**: The player can control the snake's direction using the arrow keys (up, down, left, right).

- **Scoring**: The game keeps track of the player's score, which increases each time the snake consumes food.

- **Game Over**: The game ends when the snake collides with the screen boundaries or itself, displaying a "Game Over" message along with the player's final score.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

- Pygame library (install using `pip install pygame`)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the script.

2. Run the Python script to start the game.
